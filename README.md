# FarmWell
An effective and complete solution to the irrigation problem faced by farmers, that uses a sophisticated and well structured cloud backend schema to help the farmers specify the amount of water required per crop per acre of land. 
   
All this information is used in combination with real time data provided by a combination of GPS, weather forecast and a myriad of related sensors in order to predict efficiently the amount of water that has to be pumped per day on to the field thereby keeping the wastage of water at a minimum.
